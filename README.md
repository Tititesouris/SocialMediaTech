The World Happiness Report (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report) is a reference to know how citizens feel about their country.
We would like to experiment creating our own index by analysing tweets mentioning countries.
We want to record any tweet mentioning a country within our watch list, in any language spoken by the countries on that watch list.
Then we can group the tweets by their origins (we only record tweets with location data).
Then we can analyse through the number, the nature and the sentiment of the tweets, how people talk about their own country, and how they talk about the other countries on the watch list.
We have thus 2 main research questions:
How do countries perceive themselves?
How do countries perceive each other?
We’re hypothesizing that we’ll see a correlation with the World Happiness Report for the first question and that we will see diplomatic relationships emerge from the second question.

Potential problems:
Few tweets have location data, and maybe that those that do are not representative.
Potential bias towards negative. When talking about a country (especially our own) on social media, it is probably more likely to be negatively skewed, as you wouldn’t really think to share your thoughts about a country when everything is fine. You would share nation accomplishments such as winning sports competitions though, so maybe it won’t be that bad.
The popularity of Twitter varies from country to country, making our results for each country not perfectly comparable.

Notes (Add them as thoughts come to you):
We wanted to be sure we were using the right keywords, and that we could clean and decipher the results easily so we selected countries where at least one of us was familiar with its language and culture.
We had to limit the number of countries because we would hit the limit.
In croatian the ending changes depending on the mode, we chose to ignore that
